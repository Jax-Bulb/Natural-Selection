# Natural Selection

This was made in 1 and a half months for the Svelte Hackathon. I used SvelteKit, along with BabylonJS and ChartJS. I also used Svelte Sliders from [simeydotme's svelte range sliders](https://github.com/simeydotme/svelte-range-slider-pips).

# What is it?
This project is designed to simulate a 3D virtual environment with three animals: mice, snakes, and cats. The cats eat the snakes, and the snakes eat the mice. The goal of this is to help more people understand how natural selection works, disproving myths like animals that adapt in their lifetime, rather than over time via evolution. You are going to be able to watch animals evolve in real time, and control what they do indirectly. Don't like how easy the cats have it? Change their speed to 3, or set the maximum hunger to 10. There is also a restults screen, using line charts from ChartJS.

### Happy Svelting!
